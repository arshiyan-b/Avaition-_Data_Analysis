# Executive Summary 
**Objectives:**
● Over the past fourteen years, aviation accident rates have shown limited improvement. 
● This has resulted in a continued occurrence of injuries within the industry. 
● Despite ongoing safety efforts, accidents have not significantly decreased. 
● This trend emphasizes the need for continued vigilance and safety enhancement in aviation. 

**Key Problems:**
Over the past fourteen years, the aviation industry has witnessed a concerning trend where the rate of aviation accidents and resulting injuries has remained relatively stable, showing limited signs of improvement. 

**Define objectives:** 
Analyze aviation data to check the trend in the enhancement of safety and give recommendations to improve safety on the aviation system at different points.

**Stakeholders:** 
• Regulatory bodies like the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States or the European 
Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) may be interested in findings like this. 
• Airport Authorities play a critical role in aviation because they monitor air traffic.  

**Data Analysis Process / Approach:**
● Understanding Key Problems and Define Objectives 
● Data Preparation and Cleaning 
● Data Processing and Analysis 
● Visualization, generating insights and Recommendations 

**Recommendations:**  
● The air spaces of cities with the most accidents reported, especially with the mid-air 
collisions should be monitored more strictly. 
● More experienced pilots should be given priority in sensitive areas in the peak months of 
the year. 
● The daytime routine should be monitored with more focus in the future. 
● The planes with engines having fuel injected type must be given proper maintenance after 
each time interval to avoid engine explosion.
